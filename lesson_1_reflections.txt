Is version control really necessary? 
Oh yes!

How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It showed me the differences between two files

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
I can try new things and come back if it doesn't work out.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
Meaningfull history when you come back and see provided you gave commit messages.
Automatic saving might be useful when you forgot to commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
It is very likely that every project will have morethan one inter related files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
I can go back at any time if messed up something.
